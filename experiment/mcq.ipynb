However, without the text, we cannot confirm if the \\\"correct\\\" answers align perfectly with the source material's emphasis.\\n5.  **Distractors:** The distractors are well-crafted. They are plausible enough to require careful reading but distinct enough from the correct answer (assuming a standard Python introduction) to be clearly incorrect.\\n6.  **Cognitive and Analytical Abilities:** This is the primary area where the quiz falls short for Computer Science students.\\n    *   **Question 1:** Tests basic identification of a core characteristic.\\n    *   **Question 2:** Tests direct recall of an application area.\\n    *   **Question 3:** Tests recall of a specific set of application areas.\\n    These questions are low on Bloom's Taxonomy, primarily assessing 'Remembering' and 'Understanding'. Computer Science students are expected to engage in higher-order thinking such as 'Applying', 'Analyzing', 'Evaluating', and 'Creating'. The quiz, in its current form, does not sufficiently challenge their analytical or problem-solving skills regarding Python's concepts and implications.

      "Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.[1] Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "ML finds application in many fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, email filtering, agriculture, and medicine. The application of ML to business problems is known as predictive analytics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Statistics and mathematical optimisation (mathematical programming) methods comprise the foundations of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis (EDA) via unsupervised learning.[3][4]\n",
      "\n",
      "From a theoretical viewpoint, probably approximately correct learning provides a mathematical and statistical framework for describing machine learning. Most traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be described as empirical risk minimisation under this framework.\n",

      "History\n",
      "See also: Timeline of machine learning\n",
      "The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.[5][6] The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period.[7][8]\n",
      "\n",
      "The earliest machine learning program was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a computer program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, but the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes.[9] In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells.[10] Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data.[9] Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.\n"
